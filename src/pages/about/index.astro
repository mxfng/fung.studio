						My mediums include songwriting, audio production, digital art, web/mobile development,
						and branding.
					</p>
					<p>
						I run <a href="https://www.studiomakai.net">Studio Makai</a>, a small creative studio in
						LA focused on projects at the intersection of sound, software, and storytelling.
					</p>
					<p>
						I make music as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tokomakai/">Toko Makai</a> and <a
							href="https://www.instagram.com/fungkadelic/">Max Fung</a
						>, writing and producing for myself and others. I was born into a musical family and
						basically grew up in the studio.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've worked professionally in software since 2021—mostly frontend, architecture, and web
						platforms for startups and tech companies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the years, I've been lucky to work with thoughtful people on meaningful projects to
						bring creative and technical ideas to life.

					<p>Thanks for stopping by. CV available upon request.</p>
