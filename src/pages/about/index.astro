								<span class="text-foreground">Songwriting and music production.</span> I’ve created original
								music for major labels, independent artists, and licensing firms across film and television.
								My work spans lyrics, topline, and full production, with a genre-spanning toolkit shaped
								by over a decade of experience in pop, electronic, R&B, funk, soul, and hip-hop. Songs
								I've written and produced have been streamed by hundreds of thousands of people and have
								been licensed for use in popular media.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="text-foreground">Web/mobile development.</span> I’ve partnered with startups,
								agencies, and enterprise teams to build websites and apps—from early MVPs to production
								systems. My background in-house gives me an edge in advising on design systems, software
								architecture, and cultivating strong engineering practices. With nearly a decade of programming
								experience, I help teams launch fast. Whether it’s laying foundational code, crafting
								polished marketing sites, or scaling early-stage engineering efforts.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="text-foreground">Graphic design and branding.</span> I’ve delivered visual
								identities, logos, and marketing collateral for nonprofits, universities, and small businesses.
								My work balances art direction with strategic clarity to help brands express themselves
								meaningfully and consistently.
