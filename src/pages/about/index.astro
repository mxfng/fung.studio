            <p>
              I’m a creative person with a software engineering problem. A
              lifelong musician, artist, tinkerer, and designer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My mediums include songwriting, audio production, digital art,
              web/mobile development, and branding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I run <a href="https://www.studiomakai.net">Studio Makai</a>, a
              small creative studio in LA focused on projects at the
              intersection of sound, software, and storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              I make music as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tokomakai/"
                >Toko Makai</a
              > and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fungkadelic/">Max Fung</a
              >, writing and producing for myself and others. I was born into a
              musical family and basically grew up in the studio.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve worked professionally in software since 2021—mostly frontend,
              architecture, and web platforms for startups and tech companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, I've been lucky to work with thoughtful people on
              meaningful projects to bring creative and technical ideas to life.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by. CV available upon request.</p>
