						<p>
							I'm a creative person with a software engineering problem. A lifelong musician,
							artist, tinkerer, and designer.
						</p>
						<p>
							My mediums include songwriting, audio production, digital art, web/mobile development,
							and branding.
						</p>
						<p>
							I run <a href="https://www.studiomakai.net">Studio Makai</a>, a small creative studio
							in LA focused on projects at the intersection of sound, software, and storytelling.
						</p>
						<p>
							I make music as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tokomakai/">Toko Makai</a> and <a
								href="https://www.instagram.com/fungkadelic/">Max Fung</a
							>, writing and producing for myself and others. I was born into a musical family and
							basically grew up in the studio.
						</p>
						<p>
							I've worked professionally in software since 2021â€”mostly frontend, architecture, and
							web platforms for startups and tech companies.
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the years, I've been lucky to work with thoughtful people on meaningful projects
							to bring creative and technical ideas to life.
