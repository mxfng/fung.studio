Millionaire Max was the alias I used while writing, producing, and performing hip hop between 2016 and 2018. What started as genuine admiration for the genre quickly became an obsession. I recorded hundreds of tracks during that time, often chasing an identity I hadn’t fully grown into.

Several of the songs gained traction on SoundCloud, reaching over 100,000 plays before I made the catalog private. The decision was equal parts artistic evolution and personal discomfort. As I matured, the themes I had explored began to feel disconnected from who I was becoming.

A few songs still hold up. Repetition was a rare moment of clarity—a self-critical reflection on insecurity, ego, and escapism. Legends, which was never released, may have been the project’s most defining work. It was a heavy, autotuned anthem that nearly led to a ghostwriting deal, offered only if I agreed to leave college behind.

Millionaire Max existed at a time when I was trying to figure out what it meant to create something real. I learned a lot about music. I learned even more about myself.
