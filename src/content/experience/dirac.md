In 2024, I joined Dirac as a Lead Software Engineer. The challenge was big: reimagine their entire front-end platform — a React app deeply tied to complex CAD data and real-time mechanical workflows.

We rebuilt from scratch. New foundation: Vite, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit. I designed a new virtualized tree structure to model part hierarchies — thousands of nodes, each representing a physical component in a mechanical assembly. I wrote the frontend architecture and a custom component library that synced optimistically with our Go backend. Performance went up. Load times dropped by over 90%.

But the part I’m most proud of? It wasn’t just faster. It made sense. It felt right. It gave the team new leverage. I helped mentor other devs, shape system architecture, and design APIs around file uploads, Redis caching, DynamoDB records, and gRPC service definitions. We built the foundation for something that had never existed before: a software platform that understands how real machines go together.
