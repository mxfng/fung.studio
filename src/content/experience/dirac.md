Dirac, Inc. is a software company headquartered in New York, specializing in bridging the gap between design and manufacturing. Their flagship product, BuildOS, automates the creation of assembly work instructions directly from CAD files using advanced physics and geometry simulations.

I joined Dirac as a Lead Software Engineer, where I led the front-end rebuild of BuildOS. I architected their core data model that connects everything from step editing to animation sequencing, while also guiding the design and implementation of the entire UI, shaping the visuals, UX, and interaction model.

The result wasnâ€™t just a large performance improvement; it was a powerful, technically advanced product that met the expectations of demanding enterprise customers, unlocked early sales, and positioned the company for its first major external deployment of its flagship application.
