Before that, I was at Flexe.

I joined in 2022, when the company was scaling fast and the codebase was evolving daily. My role spanned frontend and backend, but what really made the work meaningful was the clarity of purpose: logistics at a planetary scale, rendered legible through thoughtful software.

I worked on new backend services, helped modernize the mobile app with Kotlin, and shipped features that enabled warehouse operators to fulfill orders in real time. I cared deeply about the polish. I obsessed over UI details — margins, loading states, animations — because I knew these weren’t just design choices. They were moments of cognitive relief for someone in a warehouse trying to get through their day.

I also helped build internal tools for sales and support teams — the kind of invisible software that actually holds a company together. It was fast-moving, collaborative work, and it taught me how to balance velocity with care.
