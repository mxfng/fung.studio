Flexe is a Seattle-based logistics technology company that provides on-demand warehousing and fulfillment infrastructure for enterprise supply chains.

This was my first real role in tech. They took a chance on me, and it changed everything.

I joined as the company was scaling fast. I helped modernize the Android mobile app, with a goal to make it feel world-class. I obsessed over rhythm, loading states, and messaging. It was here that I discovered how much I care about polish, about the intersection of front-end development and design.

Alongside that, I contributed to backend services in Ruby and Kotlin, helped migrate APIs, and gained firsthand experience in how enterprise software is built and scaled.

Most of all, I got to work with some incredibly sharp and generous people who helped shape how I think, write code, and collaborate. Flexe gave me the foundation I build on every day.
