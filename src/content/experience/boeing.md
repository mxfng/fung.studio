I got my start at Boeing.

Right out of college, I found myself in the heart of a massive engineering org, building tools that tracked the production of spacecraft components — tiny boards and assemblies destined for orbit.

I wrote Python scripts that automated quality assurance. I built a full-stack tracking system that let technicians see where each part was, what tests it had passed, and when it would be ready to ship. That data used to live in spreadsheets and Post-It notes. We turned it into software.

I didn’t know it then, but that experience shaped how I think about software: as a form of infrastructure. Invisible when it’s working, vital when it breaks. The kind of work where elegance lives in the background, quietly making the complex more humane.
