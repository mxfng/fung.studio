My software career started at Boeing in El Segundo. Right out of college, I found myself in the heart of a massive engineering org, where I carved out a niche building tools that tracked the production of spacecraft components. I built a full-stack tracking system that let project managers and technicians see where each part was, what tests it had passed, and when it would be ready to ship. That data used to live in spreadsheets and Post-It notes. Seeing that impact early on is what pushed me to keep going.
