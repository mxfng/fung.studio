Venice is one of Los Angeles' strangest neighborhoods. It's a patchwork of scenes that don't quite belong together: bohemian art, carnival kitsch, humble bungalows, luxury boxes. Streets are tight here, some with barely enough width to fit two cars passing each other by. A disturbing clown in a ballerina suit atop the entrance to a CVS. Gothic sculptures are carved into pillars on old buildings. There's short blocks, odd diagonals, and even canals. These quirks are the surviving remnants of a much bigger experiment.

Venice has a lot of character, but to me, it's always felt like something's a bit off. All the details lack cohesion. It’s classy and trashy at the same time. Skaters, artists, gangsters, and weirdos gave this place its edge, made it cool, contributed to its soul. Dogtown, beat poets, Jim Morrison and The Doors, Z-Boys, Venice Shoreline Crips, Arnold Schwarzenegger, an absurd list of culture born from one little neighborhood.

Venice was eccentric long before Morrison scrawled lyrics in a cheap apartment. The neighborhood was the brainchild of Abbot Kinney, a wealthy tobacco magnate who decided in 1905 to carve a "Venice of America" out of the marshland. He built sixteen miles of canals, imported gondoliers from Italy, and filled the beachfront with arcades, hotels, and amusement rides to get people in. Once upon a time, the Pacific Electric streetcar line ended in Venice. The city was a bold attempt to graft a slice of Europe onto the California coast while also appealing to the Americana tastes of the time.

Kinney's vision, however, didn't last. Maintaining miles of canals was expensive, and after his death in 1920, the neighborhood no longer had a wealthy, eccentric champion. Cars began to dominate Los Angeles, and in that new reality, gondolas were uncool as ever. In 1924, shortsighted, befuddled residents couldn't see the gold mine in front of them, probably because all the water started smelling like human excrement, and voted to pave over their canals to make more room for sweet, sweet gasoline-powered automobiles. Venice got annexed into Los Angeles in 1926, and the bureaucrats downtown had zero interest in preserving Kinney's dream. This marked the beginning of period of steep decline, and by the mid-century, Venice had earned itself a new nickname, the "Slum by the Sea".

We can take some insights away from this history: private vision can spark something extraordinary, but without public stewardship even the boldest ideas are destined to fade into obscurity. Kinney’s canals were a brilliant idea. Just look at some of the world’s most desirable cities: Venice in Italy, or Amsterdam. People love those places because waterways, when properly maintained, are not only functional but incredibly beautiful. But Los Angeles—just as it did with the streetcar—was unwilling to invest. We collectively chose asphalt over imagination, and in doing so, lost the chance to build something truly unique.

What if Los Angeles had chosen to preserve the canals instead of paving them? What if the city had expanded and maintained them, weaving public amenities into the waterways? What if Venice had become a dense, walkable neighborhood, with plazas on every corner, bikes and trams connecting to the beach, cafés and groceries tucked into each block?

Venice could have been our Venice on the Pacific in the truest sense, a place where water and public space shaped everyday life. Instead, the canals were sacrificed to cars, and Venice became just another car-centric neighborhood in a car-centric city. The irony is that Venice’s bones do a terrible job of supporting car use. Anyone who’s driven there knows it’s awful trying to find parking or squeezing down the tight streets.

Cars don’t just clog the streets and pollute the air, they flatten our imagination. They make places interchangeable: wider roads, driveways, parking lots, zoning that separates houses from shops. A unique gem like Venice isn't resistant to this kind of inertia. It gets pushed toward something more bland and generic, homogenizing into the broader American built space. Kinney could dream up a city of canals because cars weren’t yet the organizing principle. Once they were, Los Angeles stopped imagining altogether.

I see a neighborhood warped by tasteless wealth: glass shoeboxes eating up their postage-stamp lots, G-Wagons clogging streets paved before the existence of SUVs. It's a continuation of the lack of imagination that's plagued Los Angeles since the car took over, a refusal to see the beauty in what's already there. Venice's fascinating history has attracted wealth in recent years, and rich homeowners are steadily sucking the character out of the neighborhood. Self-indulgent, Erewhon smoothie-sucking yuppies are paving over the eccentricity with their money.

Venice deserves the opposite. It should be a city meant for wandering on foot, by bike, or even by gondola. Imagine plazas opening up at odd intersections, where corner groceries and galleries spilling into the street, where canals are elevated front-and-centre, not tucked away as an isolated novelty. Imagine Abbot Kinney Boulevard closed to cars and returned to water, a literal canal running through the heart of Venice. Why anyone chooses to drive through there is beyond me given all the foot traffic.

What survives of Kinney's vision is still stunning. The remaining canals are some of the most beautiful and desirable blocks in Los Angeles. They're quiet, lush, and calm, with a distinct sense of place. And it isn't just the canals that keep Venice special. The neighborhood's bones still have the DNA of pre-car imagination: tiny lots that create density, Craftsman homes pressed shoulder to shoulder, narrow streets that force intimacy and walkability. The boardwalk, even choked with all its tourists, is one of the most iconic public spaces in the entire city, one that tourists travel from across the world to experience.

Every time I walk the canals, I’m reminded of this: cities are not inevitable. They're a result of a community's choices. Through a series of bad choices, Venice has become fragmented and conflicted. And yet, even in fragments, the dream of Abbot Kinney still lingers. Just enough to make you wonder what might have been, and what still might be possible if we choose differently.
