You’d have a hard time convincing me that simpler isn’t better these days. I’ve lived complicated for too long, both in how I approach tasks and how I structure my life.

In a world obsessed with chasing the newest, shiniest thing, I’ve drifted in and out of a different mindset: one that values being mindful of what I already have. Part of that means simplifying what I keep. Fewer things means fewer liabilities when something goes wrong. Maybe that’s internalized trauma talking. For me, it feels like peace of mind.

Sometimes I swing to the other extreme, buying things impulsively to chase the “best” experience. But I often forget the cost of those additions. Everything takes up space, and space is limited in my small Los Angeles apartment. When I welcome something new without considering what’s already here, clutter follows. And clutter is my enemy. For someone as neurodivergent as I am, a clean environment is directly tied to mental clarity. I’d do well to ask where that shiny new thing will go before it displaces something that matters.

These are late-night thoughts. I don’t expect anything from them. But they remind me that I’m trying to be more intentional with what I consume. I want to live more sustainably, with more clarity, and in a way that actually makes me happy.
