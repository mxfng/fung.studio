Hello World. I just wrapped up a quick, hasty development of this website for two primary reasons:

1. I felt like it
2. I just got this NuPhy Air75 v2 keyboard with Cowberry linear switches, and they sound absolutely delightful with each letter I type

On the technical side, choosing the Astro framework meant departing from the usual React Router driven, Single Page App (SPA) experience I'm used to using to throw up static sites into the ether. I chose it because it felt like a very different approach and philosophy than what I had been developing recently and it is well optimized for content heavy sites like this one. What I realized on this go around was that I wasn't satisfied with my original resume site from 2023. While that was a great first go at a React-driven personal website, I couldn't help but think back to the site I tried setting up with Vanilla JS/HTML in 2022 during my trip to Michigan. There was something so pure and beautiful about that approach, I couldn't help but feel like I was missing something wonderful chasing after the shiniest, fanciest, most modern approaches and frameworks to web development.

There is something to be said for the simplicity of HTML and CSS when it comes to front end development. If it weren't for my sheer velocity using TailwindCSS, I'd probably have used that here too. Astro felt like a great compromise between the performance and minimalism of a static HTML site with the capacity to shove in some React client components where complexity warranted. I initially coded up a few React components out of sheer laziness and ignorance to the new domain I was programming in, but I quickly realized that the advantages to using Astro were in cutting this kind of behavior back. Why add JavaScript where it isn't needed? I realized just how many components in a simple site like this can thrive as simple `.astro` files. No JS needed. I also realized how much easier life is when you cut back flashy features and animations for simple, good UX. Users don't want things floating around and reacting dynamically all the time. I realize that I'm often designing for other designers, who might care about technical verbosity in UX as opposed to a simpler approach. Sometimes we need to get back to the basics to realize we were overcomplicating our creative approach.

This was also an ample opportunity to explore my creative past; those elements about myself that are more unhinged, unprofessional, and raw. I can't lose sight of what makes me unique, what makes me human. I explored the various projects I'd worked on over the last 10 years, the awesome people I collaborated with to realize those goals, and the incredible output I'd produced when applying myself and working through my perfectionism and lack of executive function. When I hyper-focus on something, anything is possible, until the constraint of self-care kicks in and the burn out hits. I've always been streaky like that, with music and coding.

As much as I try to identify with the tech world, it's constantly reminding me that I am an outsider and always will be. I'm an artist, a creative, and a visionary. Corporate jobs cannot quench my thirst for self actualization in the creative process. I need room and resources to experiment. It was the primary reason I chose this profession in the first place - to enable the financial freedom to be who I am. Now that this website is up, I plan on updating my Works section with additional new projects in the pipeline. I'll also be journaling and writing more of my thoughts here.

Thanks for checking this out and stay tuned.
