Though I've resided in Los Angeles for many years, I've seldom visited MacArthur Park. For a long time, I wasn't even aware of its existence, let alone its rich history. At some point, there came a day when a route I was on passed it by, and for the first time I saw it: a picturesque lake crowned by a fountain that bursts towards the sky, a tranquil oasis amidst a bustling city. Grand old trees lined its edges, meandering footpaths along gentle curves, with smooth fields of green grass, against a backdrop of distant skyscrapers.

The surrounding neighborhood showed clear signs of sustained decline: payday loan storefronts, boarded-up shops, trash bags split open on the sidewalks, their contents mingling with windblown litter. A man nodded off against a graffitied wall, layers of paint behind him telling the story of countless attempts to erase the same tags. Beautiful old buildings — Spanish Revival, Art Deco, Beaux-Arts — stood subtly within the deteriorating urban form. They looked tired now, their facades cracked and faded through years of weathering and neglect.

Neglect felt central to the condition of the place. A bitter, visual poverty crept over the edges of the sidewalks and into the park itself. Surfaces were defaced with writing, cracked and stained. Up close, the water appeared murky and ominous. There was a chilling sense of despair that was impossible to overlook. Human bodies lay inanimate, folding in on themselves like broken marionettes on benches. The park, imagined for the public, including families and children, felt abandoned by them — the space now inhabited by unhoused or by solitary men drifting through, their presence lending the air a quiet tension, a loneliness that seemed to swallow the open space whole.

A vibrant patchwork of street vendors lined the surrounding walkways of the neighborhood, huddled beneath makeshift tents that sag and fade in the sun. They were selling a cacophony of goods, of varying quality and mysterious origin. Their patrons form a mosaic of Los Angeles' overlooked — immigrants, many from across Latin America; the children of those immigrants; day laborers; the unhoused and those teetering on the edge of it. Some bear the grime of hard living, dirt ground into their palms and under their nails. Their faces and expressions bear an uncanny resemblance to their surroundings: resilient, weary, etched with the quiet endurance of life on the city's margins.

## Los Angeles Had Its Champs-Élysées

We cannot grasp the depth of MacArthur Park's decline without first understanding the height from which it fell. To see only its decay is to miss its former promise — the dream it once embodied, the civic optimism that shaped its creation. Remembering the essence of what this place was imagined to be helps to magnify the despair of its decline; it reveals the dissonance between the city's past ambitions and its present neglect.

Around the turn of the century, MacArthur Park — then known as "Westlake Park" — was the crown jewel of a young city. Once a swampy, unclaimed stretch of land, it was dedicated to the public and eventually transformed into a sanctuary, modeled after the great urban parks of the East Coast and Europe. Its lake, fed by fresh water, reflected rows of imported palms and the carved facades of elegant boathouses built in the fashionable styles of the day. Along its edges, flowering shrubs framed curving promenades and walking paths. At the water's edge, sailboats glided across the lake and horse-drawn buggies traced slow circuits through the park's shaded driveways.

It was, for a time, a public resort in everything but name. On Sundays, musicians performed in the band shell as crowds in fine hats and parasols gathered along the shore to listen and dance. Boating was a civic pastime: Angelenos from all across the city rented rowboats, canoes, and small sailboats to glide across the mirrored water. Many boathouses were built, the grandest of them having a sweeping staircase descending to the waterline like something out of a seaside hotel. Bell Sumner Angier wrote in 1903 that "of all the parks in Los Angeles, there is none better loved by the people than Westlake." Local papers called it "the most popular open-air resort in the city," and by 1910 it drew more than half a million visitors each year.

The streets around the lake advertised a new vision for Los Angeles — dense, stylish, and deliberately cosmopolitan. Streetcars ran straight into the park, turning a fashionable address into a truly public stage. The neighborhood was brimming with apartment facades in Queen Anne and Beaux-Arts dress; elegant mansions and palm-lined promenades. Across Wilshire — which at the time ended at the park's edge — Harrison Gray Otis's bequest seeded the Otis Art Institute, anchoring the district's cultural gravity. A block away, the Westlake Theatre opened in 1926 with nearly two thousand seats and a Spanish-Baroque flourish. At the time, guidebooks and newspapers weren't shy about the comparison: Westlake was the Champs-Élysées of Los Angeles — a place where elegance and grandeur sat front and center in civic life, if only for a brief moment in history.
