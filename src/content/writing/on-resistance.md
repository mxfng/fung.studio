Today, I've been reflecting on what protest actually means in America, and ultimately what it means for me. There is a sanitized version of protest that exists in civics textbooks, but what about the real and messy practice of resistance in action? What does protest look like when it's effective? What tools have truly shifted power? And where does protest fit into the broader American story?

The First Amendment—one of the most striking facets of the Constitution—protects the right to assemble and express political views. That idea is woven into the cultural fabric I grew up with, and it’s one I support. But our legal system doesn’t grant unlimited freedom. “Time, place, and manner” restrictions carve out narrow channels through within which we may exercise our free speech rights. Police and government officials decide the narrow constraints. Protest here isn’t entirely free; it’s tolerated within carefully drawn lines.

There’s no shared vision of what protest should look like, aside from the vague expectation that it remain peaceful. There are many who view it positively, seeing it as a tool to express resistance, mobilize communities, and demand the attention of power. It can be a place to vent frustration, find solidarity, or gather strength from being among others who want the same change.

But protest also carries with it negative associations. Blocking a freeway is often viewed more as an ineffective inconvenience than legitimate civic action. Like many political conversations in America, small talk often centers itself within the confines of our car-centric environment. When disruption collides with peoples' daily lives, it's easy to frame protest as chaos, violence, or simply "in the way". Whenever change is demanded, there's an in-group that benefits from the status quo, and those people predictably resent it. And for millions more living at the edge of exhaustion, even a freeway closure can feel like one burden too many. Support for protest often depends less on principle and more on whether someone agrees with the cause, or has the bandwidth to care at all.

There's also the murkier territory of performance. Attending a protest might be purely self-indulgent, or a means to garner social capital. Attending a protest to them is like earning a badge of moral superiority. It can become a spectacle of participation rather than a strategy for change. Opportunists exploit this, too, using crowds as cover to steal, vandalize, and fight. The line between mobilization and spectacle is easily blurred.

Humans are biased, emotional, and inconsistent. The best among us try and shed such bias, understanding protest as a necessary lever within a democratic society to push people to think and act differently; a mechanism for self-correction and political evolution. But understanding that truth isn't enough. A real grasp of protest requires confronting what it looks like and feels like in practice, and rooting that understanding in the context of the past.

When protest has mattered in this country, it's rarely been "polite". Two of the clearest examples come from the labor movement and the civil rights movement.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, labor uprisings shook the foundations of industrial America. The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 began as localized work stoppage in West Virginia and exploded across multiple states, grinding rail freight, the lifeblood of the economy, to a halt. It was one of the first truly national uprisings in U.S. history.

The strike was crushed by coordinated, state-sanctioned violence at the hands of federal troops and private militias, opening fire on workers, killing around 100 people. Despite the defeat, the strike exposed the boiling opposition between labor and capital, galvanized workers, and seeded the growth of organized labor in the decades to come.

The following decades were marked by escalating confrontations: the Homestead strike, the Pullman strike, and countless others. Strikers were routinely beaten, shot, or starved out, but workers organized and persevered to put pressure on the government and corporations. Out of these sustained struggles we now enjoy the eight-hour workday, weekends, workplace safety standards, and the right to unionize. Many things we take for granted were built on the backs of these protestors, who faced violent resistance.

Nearly a century later, the civil rights movement forever changed the fabric of American society. The Montgomery bus boycott lasted over a year, draining the city's transit system and proving that Black communities could exert sustained economic pressure. Sit-ins across the South disrupted segregated businesses. Freedom riders deliberately defied racist laws, forcing national attention on local terror. In the Birmingham campaign, protestors, including children, faced fire hoses and attack dogs. In the Selma to Montgomery marches, protestors were beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge as the country watched.

Over ten years ago, I read Martin Luther King Jr.'s [Letter from Birmingham Jail](https://www.csuchico.edu/iege/_assets/documents/susi-letter-from-birmingham-jail.pdf), and it was a pivotal point in my own enlightenment in civic resistance. Realizing that the same U.S. government that now elevates King as a national hero once locked him in a jail cell decades ago is a sobering reminder of how dissent is treated in its own time. But more than that, his words revealed a view of protest that was both deeply strategic and morally clear.

King described protest as purposeful disruption, not mere symbolism:

> “In any nonviolent campaign, there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices are alive, negotiation, self-purification, and direct action.”  
> — Martin Luther King Jr.

He explained how rights on paper collide with power in practice:

> “We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.”
> — Martin Luther King Jr.

He rejected the call to “wait your turn”:

> “For years now I have heard the word ‘Wait!’ ... This ‘Wait’ has almost always meant ‘Never.’”
> — Martin Luther King Jr.

And he exposed how protest is often criminalized and framed as illegitimate:

> “You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws… There are two types of laws: there are just laws and there are unjust laws.”
> — Martin Luther King Jr.

King understood that protest isn't meant to make anyone comfortable, and we should too. It exists to force a reckoning. His words are as relevant now as they were in 1963, because they lay bare a truth this country still struggles to confront. Meaningful change rarely happens within the boundaries power sets for us.

So again, I raise the simple question: what should protest look like?

There was a No Kings demonstration in Venice Beach today. Picture this: protestors waiting patiently at the crosswalk for the signal to turn green. People holding signs, standing on the sidewalk, taking selfies, shouting into the void of passing traffic. Blaring horns, deafening noise from cars and motorcycles. Protestors telling people to get out of the street, because that’s not “acceptable.”

There were signs like “Alexa, change the president”—which is almost self-parody, considering Alexa is an Amazon product, and its founder Jeff Bezos sat front row at Trump’s inauguration. Someone held up an “I miss Obama” sign, which just felt hollow. Obama isn’t coming back, and nostalgia won’t build a movement. His administration expanded drone warfare, deepened free-market orthodoxy, and maintained the same foreign-policy posture that defined the post-Reagan era. Even if he were on the ballot, what does that sentiment actually do to resist Trump? What does it build?

The whole thing felt messy, shallow, unorganized—a mishmash of privileged white opinions and disconnected frustrations. Framing that kind of protest against the civil rights movement makes it look almost absurd. It gave me the ick. Beyond disliking Trump, what exactly are Americans protesting? There are real reasons to be in the streets: ICE raids and mass deportations, tariffs and economic cruelty, the moral rot of Trump’s ties to Epstein, bailouts for foreign banks, government shutdowns, attacks on reproductive rights and healthcare, the relentless assault on the poorest and most marginalized. The stakes are enormous. But the protest I saw didn’t reflect that urgency.

The entire point of protest is to be uncomfortable, especially to those in power. But here, in car-dominated America, our protests are herded to the curb. We’re delegated to the sidewalks, little strips of concrete representing the boundaries we’ve agreed to live inside. It’s acceptable to block people on foot, but we draw the line at people in cars, as if the right to uninterrupted traffic outweighs the right to collective voice. The street, which once belonged to people, has been ceded entirely to machines, and so has our imagination of what public space can be.

It’s a strange kind of resistance—neatly contained, pre-approved, zoned like a land-use plan. We’ve learned to express rage in a way that never slows commerce, never disturbs the flow, never truly disrupts the world we’re supposed to be challenging. Our physical place in the protest mirrors our political place: tolerated, but never taken seriously.

I can’t help but ask: is that what protest is supposed to look like? Would the labor movement have won anything if they’d politely waited for the walk sign? Would the civil rights movement have dismantled segregation without sit-ins, boycotts, marches that blocked streets and bridges—direct action that forced a response?

Can Americans escape the comforts of modern technology, the consumerism, the allegiance to corporations, the willful ignorance of their own class struggle—the billionaires versus everyone else—and mobilize against the actual foundations that put Trump into power? Or are we simply organizing because, for a thousand different and often conflicting reasons, we collectively don’t like him? It feels like so much of the outrage has been aimed at the man, not the machinery that made him inevitable. Anger at an individual is easy. Dismantling the structure beneath him is the hard part.

And in the age of mass surveillance, where biometric and geographic data are quietly harvested, where every intimate detail is for sale to the highest bidder, and where the doors to fascism have been left swinging open, can we ever resist the way we once did? Pondering these questions doesn’t bring clarity, it only raises more questions for me.

I don’t know if protest works the way it used to. But I know the useful form isn’t meant to be comfortable. It won’t look polite. It won’t be convenient. It will be controversial precisely because that’s the point. Real resistance isn’t designed to make people feel good about showing up—it’s meant to make power flinch.
