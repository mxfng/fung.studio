		I believe in the power of love, music, and creativity to guide us, heal us, and connect us to a
		deeper source.
	</p>

	<p class="font-manifesto leading-normal">
		I believe in building beautiful, sustainable things â€” slowly, with care. In craftsmanship,
		passion, and mastery.
	</p>

	<p class="font-manifesto leading-normal">
		I believe in stewarding this planet. In shaping systems that protect and restore what's finite
		and precious. In leaving things better than we found them.

	<p class="font-manifesto mt-8 leading-normal">
		Look for the things you see which others cannot. Always follow your heart and your gut. Don't
		let others define what you can and can't create. You define that for yourself.
	</p>

	<p class="font-manifesto mt-8 leading-normal">
		Find something you love to do, and do it every single day.
	</p>

	<p class="font-manifesto mt-8 leading-normal">Be kind. Be humble. Be present. Know yourself.</p>

	<p class="font-manifesto mt-8 leading-normal">The world will be a better place for it.</p>
