Personal website showcasing works across music, design, and engineering. Built with Astro and Tailwind CSS.

I wanted to rebuild my personal site to showcase more of my creative work and serve as a de facto home base for all of my creations over the years. I decided to build this site with Astro because I preferred something higher performance and
content-rich, and also wanted to try out a new framework without leaning so heavily on React all the time. The result is something I am very pleased with. I also wanted to leverage Bun as a package manager and script executer here, although I am not getting the full benefit yet by running this project with Vite.

I ended up programming a sort of messy content pipeline with image and video optimization scripts leveraging `sharp` and `ffmpeg` to compress media and convert everything to .webp format in order to streamline the large amount of pictures and videos being stored and served via the cloud.

## Dependencies used

- [Astro](https://astro.build) - Static Site Generator
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Utility-first CSS framework
